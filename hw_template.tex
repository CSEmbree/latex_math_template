 \begin{problem}{1}
    Find two real numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $x, y, x+y, x^2, y^2, x^2-y^2,x^3,y^3,x^4,y^4$ are all irrational but $x^2+y^2$ is rational.
 \end{problem}

 \solution
  Here we find $x,y \in \R$ such that the following 11 conditions are met:

 \begin{problem}{2}
    If $k\ge 2$ and $x\in\R^k$, prove that there exists $y\in\R^k$ such that $y\neq 0$ but $x\cdot y=0$. Is this also true if $k=1$?
